# About IMC

This app was built to monitor the weight and BMI (Body Mass Index). For more information on BMI click [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index). My main goal with this app was to improve my skills with Java language and learn about Firebase (Google Cloud), despite of having this goal and also learn how to use graphs with a library and build a UI (User Interface).

The user to use the app should first insert height and also age, then he can insert weight and start to monitor his weight and BMI. The height and age will be stored in the user's phone and the weight and BMI will be stored in Google Cloud.
